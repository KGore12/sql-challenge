SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
<br><br>
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

* Data Engineering

* Data Analysis
<br><br>
**_ERD Diagram_**

* Used QuickDBD to create the ERD of the tables.
